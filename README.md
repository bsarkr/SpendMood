SpendMood
By Bilash Sarkar, Yuki Li, and Chloe Velez
SpendMood is a full-stack web application that tracks your spending habits and analyzes the emotional patterns behind your purchases. Using AI-powered insights from Google Gemini, SpendMood helps users understand not just what they spend on, but whyâ€”connecting financial decisions to mood, time of day, and personal triggers.
This project combines modern web technologies with artificial intelligence to create a personalized financial wellness companion that goes beyond traditional expense trackers.
The goal of SpendMood is to deliver:

An intuitive React-based interface for logging and visualizing expenses
